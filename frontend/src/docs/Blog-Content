# Blog Content & Structure for '/understanding-qpas'

**Overall Goal:** Create an informative and easy-to-navigate documentation page for QPAS users.

**Primary Navigation:** A `magicui/bento-grid` at the top of the page will serve as an interactive Table of Contents. Each `BentoCard` will link to a specific section on the page.

## I. Interactive Table of Contents (Using magicui/bento-grid)

...
(Content for BentoGrid cards remains the same)
...

## II. Page Content Sections

Each section below will have a corresponding `id` attribute for the BentoGrid links. 
**Styling Approach:** Use Shadcn `Card` components for each section. The `CardContent` will have `prose dark:prose-invert` classes applied to give a markdown-like feel to standard HTML content (headings, paragraphs, lists, code, etc.).
