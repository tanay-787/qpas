  - Modular component-based design with reusable UI elements.
  - Responsive layouts for seamless experience across devices.
- **Backend:**  
  - RESTful API developed with **Node.js** and **Express.js**.
  - **Firebase (Firestore and Storage)** for scalable, secure data and file management.
  - Comprehensive middleware for authentication (JWT), role-based authorization, and request validation.
- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  - Secure JWT-based authentication.
  - Role checks and user context extraction in all protected routes.
- **Deployment:**  
  - Cloud-based deployment leveraging [Render.com](https://qpas.onrender.com/) for demo and production.
